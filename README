    Amateur Radio callsign database

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use Ham::Reference::QRZ;
     use Data::Dumper;

     my $qrz = Ham::Reference::QRZ->new(
       callsign => 'N8QQ',
       username => 'your_username',
       password => 'your_password'
     );

     # get the listing, bio and other information
     my $listing = $qrz->get_listing;
     my $bio = $qrz->get_bio;
     my $dxcc = $qrz->get_dxcc;
     my $session = $qrz->get_session;

     # dump the data to see how it's structured
     print Dumper($listing);
     print Dumper($bio);
     print Dumper($dxcc);
     print Dumper($session);

     # set a different callsign to look up
     $qrz->set_callsign('W8IRC');

     # get the listing and print some specific info
     $listing = $qrz->get_listing;
     print "Name: $listing->{name}\n";

     # show some dxcc info
     print "DXCC Continent: $dxcc->{continent}\n";
     print "DXCC Name: $dxcc->{name}\n";
     print "CQ Zone: $dxcc->{cqzone}\n";

     # show some session info
     print "Lookups in current 24 hour period: $session->{Count}\n";
     print "QRZ subscription expiration: $session->{SubExp}\n";

DESCRIPTION
    The "Ham::Reference::QRZ" module provides an easy object oriented front
    end to access Amateur Radio callsign data from the QRZ.COM online
    database.

    This module uses the QRZ XML Database Service, which requires a
    subscription from QRZ.COM.

    The QRZ XML Database Service specification states "The data supplied by
    the XML port may be extended in a forwardly compatible manner. New XML
    elements and database objects (with their associated elements) may be
    transmitted at any time. It is the developers responsibility to have
    their program ignore any unrecognized objects and/or elements without
    raising an error, so long as the information received consists of
    properly formatted XML."

    Therefore, this module will not attempt to list or manage individual
    elements of a callsign. You will need to inspect the hash reference keys
    to see which elements are available for any given callsign, as
    demonstrated in the synopsis.

    This module does not handle any management of reusing session keys at
    this time.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new()
     Usage    : my $qrz = Ham::Reference::QRZ->new;
     Function : creates a new Ham::Reference::QRZ object
     Returns  : a Ham::Reference::QRZ object
     Args     : a hash:

                key       required?   value
                -------   ---------   -----
                timeout   no          an integer of seconds to wait for
                                       the timeout of the xml site
                                       default = 10
                callsign  no          you may specify a callsign to look up
                                       here, or you may do it later with the
                                       set_callsign() method
                username  no          you may specify a username to log in with
                                       here, or you may do it later with the
                                       set_username() method
                password  no          you may specify a password to log in with
                                       here, or you may do it later with the
                                       set_password() method
                key       no          set a session key here if you have a valid key so
                                       that no time is wasted doing another login. only
                                       useful if you are managing the reuse of your own keys

METHODS
  set_callsign()
     Usage    : $qrz->set_callsign( $callsign );
     Function : set the callsign to look up at QRZ
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : a case-insensitive string containing an Amateur Radio callsign.
     Notes    : calling this will reset the listing and bio data to null until
                you do another get_listing() or get_bio(), respectively.

  set_username()
     Usage    : $qrz->set_username( $username );
     Function : set the username for your QRZ subscriber login
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : a string

  set_password()
     Usage    : $qrz->set_password( $password );
     Function : set the password for your QRZ subscriber login
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : a string

  set_key()
     Usage    : $qrz->set_key( $session_key );
     Function : set a session key for retrieving data at QRZ
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : a string
     Notes    : this is useful only if you already have a valid key before the first login
                during a particular instance of the module.

  set_timeout()
     Usage    : $qrz->set_timeout( $seconds );
     Function : sets the number of seconds to wait on the xml server before timing out
     Returns  : n/a
     Args     : an integer

  get_listing()
     Usage    : $hashref = $qrz->get_listing;
     Function : retrieves data for the standard listing of a callsign from QRZ
     Returns  : a hash reference
     Args     : n/a
     Notes    : if a session key has not already been set, this method will automatically login.
                if a there is already listing information set from a previous lookup,
                this will just return that data.  call a new set_callsign() if you need to refresh
                the data with a new call to the qrz database.

  get_bio()
     Usage    : $hashref = $qrz->get_bio;
     Function : retrieves data for the biography of a callsign from QRZ
     Returns  : a hash reference
     Args     : n/a
     Notes    : if a session key has not already been set, this method will automatically login.
                if a there is already biographical information set from a previous lookup,
                this will just return that data.  call a new set_callsign() if you need to refresh
                the data with a new call to the qrz database.

  get_dxcc()
     Usage    : $hashref = $qrz->get_dxcc;
     Function : retrieves DXCC information for a callsign from QRZ
     Returns  : a hash reference
     Args     : n/a
     Notes    : if a session key has not already been set, this method will automatically login.
                if a there is already dxcc information set from a previous lookup,
                this will just return that data.  call a new set_callsign() if you need to refresh
                the data with a new call to the qrz database.

  login()
     Usage    : $session = $qrz->login;
     Function : initiates a login to the QRZ xml server
     Returns  : a hash reference of the session data
     Args     : n/a
     Notes    : this generally shouldn't need to be used since the get_listing() and get_bio()
                methods will automatically initiate a login to the server if it hasn't already
                been done.

  get_session()
     Usage    : $session = $qrz->get_session;
     Function : retrieves the session information from the most recent call to the XML site
